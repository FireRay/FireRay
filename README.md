- 👋 Hi, I’m @FireRay
- 👀 I’m interested in automation testing, development and learning new programming languages. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to work better with Git and Github using terminal commands and becoming better at Java. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much everything that makes me better when it comes to computers 
- 📫 How to reach me; it's best to find me here on Github.
